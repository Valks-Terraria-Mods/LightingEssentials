Note that some colors have been made more vibrant in the screenshots above just to show what the mod can do (the defaults are much lower)

Featuring
+ Prehardmode ores are very dimmly lit making it very hard (but possible) to tell what type of ore you're looking for
+ Hardmode ores glow vibrantly based on their tile colors
+ Life crystals and life fruit glow a vibrant red
+ Enemies glow a faint red
+ The jungle glows a dim green (defeating plantera makes the jungle glow even greener)
+ The crimson and corruption glow their respective colors and defeating the bosses of these biomes will make the biomes glow even brighter
+ Walking over plants temporary gives more light to those areas
+ Pots glow based on the biome you are in
+ Meteorite and hellstone glow vibrant red
+ Containers glow a dim white
+ Swinging tools / weapons emits a faint white light
+ Player has a very dim light
+ When enemies are hit they glow red based on how much life was taken from them
+ EoC now has 100 red lights that follow it (experimental and disabled by default)

You can configure EVERYTHING now (If there is something that is not in the config that you want added please tell me)
