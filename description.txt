Note that some colors have been made more vibrant in the screenshots above just to show what the mod can do (the defaults are much lower)

Featuring
- Pre-hardmode ores are very dimly lit
- Hardmode ores glow vibrantly based on their tile colors
- Life crystals and life fruit glow a vibrant red
- The jungle glows a dim green
- Meteorite and hellstone glow vibrant red
- Containers glow a dim white
- Player has a very dim light

Roadmap
- Defeating X boss makes Y biome glow even brighter
- Reconfigure X tile to be just the right brightness

You can configure EVERYTHING now (If there is something that is not in the config that you want added please tell me)
